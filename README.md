Neck Posture AI
===
My neck posture while coding is always bending causing neck pains. This web app will help me train couple minutes a day on my posture.

It uses [Lobe.ai](https://lobe.ai) to train 5 labels. Then exported the model to run on [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), and finally created a web app to host the models and run the inference.

**Note:** Only two human subjects were used to train, Mediterranean male, and Asian female
